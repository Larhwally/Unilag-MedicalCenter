Taskid helps determine RESTful operation and most immportantly, it is used so as to be able to manage POST, PUT and GET, GET by ID all within two different procedures instead of having four procedures.
Authentication technology is not done for any of the HTTP request, assitance is very much needed.
Thank you!
